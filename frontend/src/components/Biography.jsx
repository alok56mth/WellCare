            We are Create a powerful Hospital Management System (HMS) using the
            MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The goal was
            to modernize how hospitals handle day-to-day operations like patient
            registration, doctor scheduling, appointment management, and medical
            record keeping.
          </p>
          <p>
            This system offers a centralized platform where hospital staff can
            manage tasks seamlessly, reduce paperwork, avoid manual errors, and
            improve patient care. By leveraging real-time data, secure backend
            logic, and responsive frontend design, it ensures efficiency across
            departments.
          </p>
          <p>The project combines strong technical architecture with user-focused features such as:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Role-based access for doctors, nurses, and admin staff</li>
              <li>Digital appointment scheduling</li>
              <li>Patient record tracking</li>
              <li>Alerts and notifications</li>
              <li>Scalable database support</li>
            
            </ul>
